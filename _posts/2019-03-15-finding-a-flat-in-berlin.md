Finding an apartment, or even a shared flat, can be difficult in Berlin--especially if you are new in town. The good news is that Honeypot is here to help make your move as smooth as possible, and to welcome you to Berlin with open arms! üòä 
<br>
In this post, we will provide you with 13 tips to assist you in your search for the perfect home. 
<br>
Before you start...
<br>
## Three things to consider
<br>
1. Where in [Berlin](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/neighbourhoods-berlin) do you want to live?
2. Do you want to live in a WG (shared flat) or in your own apartment? 
3. What features should your new home have? 
<br>
You can also use tools such as this [interactive chart](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/mietkarte-berlin/) to help determine where you can afford to live. 

##Finding your new home fast

4. Keep an open mind, and be flexible: It‚Äôs tough, but true. Although it is important to know what you want in a new home, your chances will ultimately increase if you are also willing to make compromises! It‚Äôs also important to be patient. This process takes time, and it is normal to go through several viewings before finding the right place. (Think of it like job hunting: you‚Äôll send applications, have an abundance of personal interviews, and finally the right offer will be on the table!)

**Bonus Tip:** The most important thing to know when looking at the rental price of a flat is the difference between ‚ÄúWarmmiete‚Äù and ‚ÄúKaltmiete.‚Äù Kaltmiete translates to ‚Äúcold rent,‚Äù and is the basic rent for the apartment without taking into account any additional costs. Warmmiete translates to ‚Äúwarm rent,‚Äù and includes the Kaltmiete plus additional costs such as water, property tax, gas, electricity, and waste disposal services. These ‚Äúside costs‚Äù are called Nebenkosten in German. 

5. Harness the power of social media: This point is especially relevant to EU residents that might have an existing social network within Europe, but is essential for everyone in the era of the internet. From job search to housing hunt, success depends on your existing network of friends and acquaintances. In Berlin especially, you will have greater success applying for a flat through a personal connection. 

How should you get the word out? Use your social media presence such as Facebook or Twitter! Even if you currently live outside Europe, you probably have connections you aren‚Äôt even aware of. I‚Äôm sure you would be surprised how many of your Facebook friends in India know someone who has a friend who knows someone currently living in Germany. They might be able to help you out! 

**Bonus Tip:** Optimize your Social Media outreach.
Share your post when most of your friends and connections are online (such as in the evening between 8pm and 9pm). Use pictures and hashtags (#) to make your post stand out. Ask your followers to like and share your post to extend your outreach and keep your post visible for a longer period of time. Find the right length for your post ‚Äì keep it concise and to the point! You may even want to consider investing in paid ads to further expand your outreach. 

6. Set up automatic alerts: Most apartment and shared flat platforms allow you to generate automatic email alerts if a suitable offer is posted that matches your requirements. 
Pro Tip: WG stands for Wohngemeinschaft - German for shared flat! 
Bonus Tip: If you are looking for something short-term for your first days or weeks after your arrival in Berlin (but you don‚Äôt want to spend your time at a hotel or hostel), we suggest you explore short term rental websites such as (Airbnb)[https://www.airbnb.de/stay/bvb], (Wimdu)[https://www.wimdu.de/], (HomeAway)[https://www.homeaway.com/], and (Wunderflats)[https://wunderflats.com/en/]! 

7. Know the secrets of searching online: Look where no one else does! 90% of people searching for housing will be searching on the same, well-known platforms. Therefore, it is helpful to look on lesser known online portals. You may also want to search at times when fewer people are online (for example, ads tend to be placed early in the morning or late at night) to make sure you are reaching out to the most recent offers. If many people have already responded to an ad, it‚Äôs less likely that you‚Äôll get a reply. 
Bonus Tip: There are also several private groups and pages on Facebook focused on apartment hunting in Berlin. You may want to consider joining smaller groups as well (ideally with less than 200 or so members) to increase your chance of getting a response!

8. Always try for direct contact: If both email and phone number are provided in the ad, always call directly. In the time of Whatsapp, you can even leave a voice message! This is a great option as many people work during the week and may not be able to answer a call. Leaving a voice message gives them the opportunity to listen whenever they have time ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs in the Ubahn on the way to work or at the gym or during the lunch break. It‚Äôs a great way to introduce yourself and explain your situation. 

9. Be creative and brazen: Try putting up an apartment or housing request in the form of a note at busy areas around your desired living location. This could be in a caf√© or at your favorite gym, yoga studio, or even on a telephone pole. 

**Bonus Tip:** Do you already have a specific neighborhood in mind? If yes, try to find supermarkets in or around this area - many stores have a ‚Äúschwarzes Brett f√ºr Anzeigen‚Äù where ads can be placed for selling or buying/renting!

10. Always keep required documents on hand: If you are looking for a flat, you must arrange the following documents and take them with you to viewings. In many cases your application will not be accepted if these documents are incomplete or missing. 
Copy of personal ID 
‚ÄúSCHUFA Auskunft‚Äù ‚Äì credit reporting (SCHUFA is a credit investigation company) 
‚ÄúMietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung - Certificate of Rent Paid (CRP) 
You may also need an assurance signed by a guarantor (for example: your parents) and proof of their payslips from the past 3 months if you cannot provide a confirmation of your own income yet. (Sometimes your contract of employment can be enough proof as well, depending who you are dealing with.)


10. Let the viewing marathon begin: This stage can be exhausting and frustrating for many flat hunters. The good news is that once you have conquered the apartment obstacle, you will feel as though you have finally arrived in Berlin ‚Äì what a relief! üòä Here are some important things to keep in mind to make it through your apartment viewings: 

Dress nicely, be friendly and polite, and shake the estate agent‚Äôs hand ‚Äì in order to be successful, you must stand out from the crowd. A nice appearance and friendly demeanor will help you score extra points against your ‚Äúcompetitors.‚Äù 
Make sure to hand in a copy of all your documents in person at the viewing.
After the viewing, send a second copy of your documents to the agency or landlord as quickly as possible via email.
In your email, thank the landlord or property agent for the tour and let them know how much you enjoyed the viewing. 

**An important note about scams!** 
Given Berlin‚Äôs competitive housing market, it‚Äôs natural for renters to feel pressure to find a flat. Because of this, people may sometimes try take advantage of your weakened position and attempt to trick you -- especially in cases when there are many people applying for the same flat! 
Follow these quick Dos and Don‚Äôts to save yourself from falling victim to a scam: 

**DON‚ÄôT** ever pay a deposit in cash! Although this practice is common in other countries, it is not the norm in Berlin and you should be suspicious of anyone who asks you for a cash deposit. If you pay in cash and you do get scammed (fingers crossed this will never happen to you!), you will have no way of proving that you transferred money to the landlord. This makes it nearly impossible to file any claim or report the scam to the police.

**DO** always have a valid contract set up! If you are not sure about the contract because it is written in German, please ask a German speaker to go over the contract with you before you sign anything. Any upstanding landlord will understand your need to take some time to check that everything is legitimate. 

**DO** conduct your own research about the landlord and look for any suspicious signs. Ask them for pictures, or for their social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) accounts, and call if you have not met in person yet. Always ask for a viewing - if they decline saying they are abroad and want you to send them the deposit first, this is a clear sign of a scam! Also be wary of landlords whose phone number country code or current address do not match the country of their bank account. 

**DON‚ÄôT** fall for scam emails! Many scam networks have set up automated emails trying to reach as many people as possible ‚Äì they do not hesitate to target everyone, regardless of demographic differences such as gender, age, or background. Please do not trust someone you have not met face to face, even if they send you a scan of their passport, bank statement, address, or the contract with a signature. Along the same lines, do NOT transfer money (especially via Western Union) under any circumstances!
